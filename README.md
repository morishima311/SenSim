# SenSim
SenSim(Sensor Simulator) allows you to simulate simple sensor - cloud communication.
Bare in mind this repository is prototype.
# How to use
There are 3 main folders: sensor, fog, cloud.
## sensor
Plz use "sensor_asyncio.py", because this script is the most sophisticated.  
Require to load YAML config file. Look at some YAML files in /sensor folder.
## fog
Currently files in this folder can be used only in my specific application.  
Useless for most of people...
## cloud
Plz use "cloud_asyncio.py", because this script is the most sophisticated.  
Require to load YAML config file. Look at some YAML files in /cloud folder.  
Can assign your InfluxDB in YAML file. Not mandatory.
