# SenSim
SenSim(Sensor Simulation) allows you to simulate simple sensor - cloud communication.
Bare in mind this repository is prototype.
# How to use
There are 3 main folders: sensor, fog, cloud.
## sensor
Plz use "sensor_asyncio.py", because this script is the most sophisticated.
Require to load yaml config file. Look at some yaml files in /sensor folder.
## fog
Currently files in this folder can be used only in my specific application.
Useless for most of people...
## cloud
Plz use "cloud_asyncio.py", because this script is the most sophisticated.
Require to load yaml config file. Look at some yaml files in /cloud folder.
Can assign your InfluxDB in yaml file. Not mandatory.
